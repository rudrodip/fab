# Fix Arpit's Blog

This is a fun little browser extension that I made to enhance blog reading experience in [Arpit Bhayani's](https://arpitbhayani.me/) blogs.

It simply modifies some css properties of the blog to make it more readable and visually appealing.

This is all it takes to make it much more readable:

```css
const blogStyle = {
  maxWidth: "48rem",
  marginLeft: "auto",
  marginRight: "auto",
  fontSize: "larger",
}
```

## Backstory

Today (10 April, 2024) I was reading Arpit's blog and I thought it would be nice if I could make it more readable. So I made this extension. Took less than 15 minutes to make it, thanks to claude sonnet.
